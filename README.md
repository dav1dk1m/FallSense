# FallSense
FallSense, a machine learning-based solution for detecting falls using pose estimation.

## Objective
The primary objective is to create a reliable system that can accurately distinguish between normal activities and potential fall incidents, particularly benefiting seniors living alone.

## Solution
FallSense project leverages pose estimation, MediaPipe, and trained model on an organized dataset of daily activities and simulated falls. Project solution integrates a LSTM neural network to process sequential pose landmarks and outputs binary fall/no-fall predictions. Development results show that the model achieved over 99% accuracy on validation data, showing the promising performance in differentiating falls from normal daily movements.
